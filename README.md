# Real-time Object Detection in Computer Vision

## Introduction
This project focuses on real-time object detection using computer vision techniques. The goal is to develop a system that can accurately detect and classify objects in real-time from video feeds or images.

## Features
- Real-time processing of video feeds
- Detection of multiple objects simultaneously
- High accuracy and speed
- Easy integration with various camera systems

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nagavenkat1289/Real-time-object-detection-Computer-Vision.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Real-time-object-detection-Computer-Vision
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the object detection script:
    ```bash
    python object_detection.py
    ```
2. Provide the path to the video feed or image file.
3. The system will display the video feed with detected objects highlighted.

## Configuration
- You can configure various parameters of the object detection system by editing the `config.py` file.
- Adjust the detection thresholds, input source, and other settings as needed.

## Models
- The project supports various pre-trained models. You can download and use models such as YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.
- Place the model files in the `models/` directory and update the `config.py` file to point to the correct model.

## Performance
- The performance of the object detection system depends on the hardware and the chosen model.
- For real-time performance, it is recommended to use a GPU.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, check the logs for error messages.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Verify that the input video feed or image file is accessible and in the correct format.
